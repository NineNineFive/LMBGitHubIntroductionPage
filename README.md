# Lars M Bek - Software Architect
Welcome to my GitHub profile
## About me
27 Year Old Software Architect and Developer from Denmark - living in Grenaa <br>
I want to contribute to other peoples project and have a personality with lots of goodwill, i'm not a money hungry person - i'm a happy person who is living my life in a way that is good for the climate and my own pocket - I refuse to get a car and would rather save the money and stay local. <br>
Feel free to contact me and work together with me, i'm a very unusual dane. But please don't sound like a spambot, seem a bit personal and commited so i don't just skip your message (because spambots) <br><br>
And i'm probably the least salary interested guy you will ever meet

## Specialities
Of all programming languages i'm best at Go(lang) and prefer it to any language because of it's simplicity and good scaling. <br>
I have specialised in Webbased IT Systems, where i build executables with manifests, icon and code signing. I both deploy software as a service (technically) and do SaaS as business. I: program, test, build and deploy software for Computers, Mobiles and the Cloud. People have a tendency to underestimate my skills ;-)
