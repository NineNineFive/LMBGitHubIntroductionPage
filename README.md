## About me
27 Year Old Software Architect and Developer from Denmark - living in Grenaa <br>
I want to contribute to other peoples project and im even willing to help for free on occasions.

I'm probably the least salary interested guy you will ever meet

Developing software that is reusable, has good optimisation, is easy to maintain and switch out, and consumes less power by not using as much hardware ressources - is good for the climate. I aim to make software that helps the planet move away from heavy software (old wordpress from 2003, very inefficient etc), and move to the right technologies. Software developers are responsible for climate change too!

## Specialities
Of all programming languages i'm best at Go(lang) and prefer it to any language because of it's simplicity and good scaling. <br>
I have specialised in Webbased IT Systems, where i build executables with manifests, icon and code signing. I both deploy software as a service (technically) and do SaaS as business. I: program, test, build and deploy software for Computers, Mobiles and the Cloud. <br>
The software i build is typically made with Go as backend with http (file)server and an API, where the frontend is build with vanilla html/css/js with some awesome technology i made myself for pageChanging, loading, maintaining and deploying software.

## Contributing
From the 1st of january 2023 the my repositories should follow the following two guidelines:
* Git Commit Messages <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification">Specification</a>. However i will write the filename instead of feat or fix, as i see no reason to push new features without having them tested first.
* Folder and File <a href="https://developers.google.com/style/filenames">naming and structure</a> (only folders and files inside repositories)
However, if you want to contribute, i will modify the changed to fit the guidelines, so feel free to contribute.
The repositories should also follow the stucture in the following section.
