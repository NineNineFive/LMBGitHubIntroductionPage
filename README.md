## About me
27 Year Old Software Architect and Developer from Denmark - living in Grenaa <br>
I want to contribute to other peoples project and im even willing to help for free on occasions.

Developing software that is reusable, has good optimisation, is easy to maintain and switch out, and consumes less power by not using as much hardware ressources - is good for the climate. I aim to make software that helps the planet move away from heavy software (old wordpress from 2003, very inefficient etc), and move to the right technologies. Software developers are responsible for climate change too!

## Specialities
Of all programming languages i'm best at Go(lang) and prefer it to any language because of it's simplicity and good scaling. <br>
I have specialised in Webbased IT Systems, where i build executables with manifests, icon and code signing. I both deploy software as a service (technically) and do SaaS as business. I: program, test, build and deploy software for Computers, Mobiles and the Cloud. <br>
The software i build is typically made with Go as backend with http (file)server and an API, where the frontend is build with vanilla html/css/js with some awesome technology i made myself for pageChanging, loading, maintaining and deploying software.

## Why i don't use frameworks for x,y,z?
I do use frameworks, however i don't use all kind of frameworks, some kind of frameworks like React, Angular or CMS like Wordpress has many cons that people don't take into consideration. Like how much memory is used, how is the arcitecture made - Is it Site Generated or server-side rendered? Is the SEO guidelines followed - can they be improved? Is seperation of concerns followed?
I prefer projects to use low ressources and have good maintainability, the existing popular frameworks don't even perform close to an A.
Also the time spent with a framework usually looks like this <br><br>
